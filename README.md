😂 Git Laughs Hook

Ever feel like your commits are too serious?
Tired of staring at dry terminal output?
We fixed that.

Git Laughs is a simple Git hook that plays a classic sitcom laugh track whenever you commit.
Yes, you heard that right—your code now comes with a laugh track.

🎭 What It Does

Every time you git commit, your computer will chuckle with you.

Even your worst code will sound like a hit 90’s sitcom.

Adds just enough chaos to brighten up those late-night commits.

🛠 Setup

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-laughs.git
cd git-laughs


Copy the commit hook into your project’s .git/hooks/ folder:

cp commit-msg .git/hooks/


Make it executable:

chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg


Add a laugh track:

Place your favorite laugh .wav file in the project root.

Or, just record yourself cackling—it works.

If you don’t have one, drop any file in and rename it laugh.wav.

🔊 Usage

Now, whenever you commit:

git commit -m "fixed bug"


Your terminal (and soul) will echo with laughter.

⚠️ Notes

Doesn’t guarantee funnier code.

May cause coworkers to question your sanity.

Works best if you commit often 😉.
